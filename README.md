# GVSU Introductory Physics Lecture Notes

## Overview

These directories will contain markdown versions of [my pdf handwritten lecture notes for each of these courses](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xTeJMP0qe1BAhTBepOhjJ5PRLVJRBaHC?usp=share_link) (see also my associated **lecture videos** for [PHY220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oNpcZg7i8E&list=PLjSlnDpzlUokf0G9DC6LxAFRRfG-LxrBZ), some topics in [PHY231/234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI8p4nRM9k8&list=PLjSlnDpzlUomCQqfgN1mrYYZU7VLhL_OZ&pp=iAQB), and a few for [PHY221](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI8p4nRM9k8&list=PLjSlnDpzlUokhoQcIyhVVS-PVht7r14xa&pp=iAQB)).

This is a work in progress: so far only a few of the PHY 231/234 notes are available as markdown text.  The directories will be updated over time.

## Fix-me's (2024)

* Fix indentation alignment for paragraphs and other elements (images, equation blocks) within itemized/enumerated lists.  It seems that this can be done cleanly for a sequence of paragraphs and inserted images, but adding a ````math...```` code block breaks it.
