## Inductors and Inductance in Circuits

We will not spend much time on inductors, or the AC (alternating current) circuits where they are important, but you should know that there is a circuit element called an inductor ($\boxed{\text{coil}}$) which is simply a coil of wire.

Qualitatively, we can understand that there will be a potential difference across the inductor
```math
\Delta V_L = \Delta V_{ab}
```
Whenever the current through the coil is *changing*. The potential difference will be due to the induced EMF (caused by the changing $\vec{B}$ field in the coil, caused by the changing current).

Closing the switch in the circuit above causes an increasing current $\rightarrow$ increasing $\vec{B}_{\text{coil}}$ $\rightarrow$ opposite $\vec{B}_{\text{ind}}$

![An inductor with current flow has its own magnetic field but when that field changes in strength (as current changes) it will also generate an induced magnetic field, which causes an opposing current.](images/16_inductors-with-current.png)
