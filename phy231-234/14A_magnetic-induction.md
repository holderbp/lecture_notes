# Magnetic Induction

## Observations of Induction

Last time we saw that moving charge or current creates a magnetic field. Today we will see, amazingly, the opposite effect: a changing magnetic field induces an electric field (or EMF) which can drive a current in a wire or other conductor.

A simple experiment demonstrates this magnetic induction of current. Consider the circuit below without a battery. When a magnet is moved into or out of the large wire loop, a current goes through the circuit and is detected by the ammeter.

Today will develop the theory which explains these experiments: Faraday's Law of Induction & Lenz's Law.

## Magnetic Flux

To describe induction correctly we need a way of specifying how much magnetic field is passing through the wire loop. This is called the flux of magnetic field through the loop's area.

The magnetic flux, $\Phi_B$, of a uniform magnetic field, $\vec{B}$, passing through a flat surface with area $A$ is given by:
```math
\Phi_B = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} = BA \cos \theta_{BA}
```
where the area vector, $\vec{A}$, has a magnitude equal to the surface's area and a direction *perpendicular to the surface*.

The flux can be thought of as proportional to the number of B-field lines that pierce the surface.  Note how the value of flux changes as the orientation of the surface changes.
