## Magnets and Magnetism

### Basic Properties of Magnets

* Magnets are intrinsically **dipolar**, having a "North" and a "South" **pole**.
* Magnetic dipoles cannot be divided into N/S monopoles, cutting a magnet in two creates two magnets:

![Bar magnet cut in half yields two bar magnets.](images/10_cutting-bar-magnet.png)

* There are **attractive/repulsive forces** between opposite/same poles:

![Like poles of two magnets repel. Opposite poles attract](images/10_attract-repel-bar-magnet.png)

* A magnet has a surrounding magnetic field (more later).

![A compass needle is a magnet.  It aligns with the magnetic field of the earth and points toward geographic North.](images/10_geomagnetic-north-compass.png)

* A magnet (e.g., a compass needle) will *align* in the magnetic field of another magnet (e.g., the Earth). (There is a torque on a magnetic dipole causing this alignment, we will not explore this further).


### Magnetic Materials

![A current loop creates a magnetic dipole field (next time).](images/10_current-loop-dipole.png)

We will see in the next lecture that moving charge (or current) creates a magnetic field. Magnetic materials (magnets) have a magnetic field because of moving charge on the atomic level.

![Electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom cause orbital currents creating magnetic fields, but also have an intrinsic "spin" creating a magnetic field](images/10_orbital-dipoles-spin.png)

There are two types of atomic-scale magnetic dipoles, due to:
1. "Orbital motion" of the electron about the nucleus,
2. "Spin" â€” an intrinsic magnetic dipole characteristic of electrons.

Note: At this small scale, these effects are necessarily quantum. Moving/spinning charge is a convenient metaphor, but an inaccurate description.

![A horseshoe magnet can cause a magnetic material to have its own magnetic field](images/10_horseshoe-magnetization.png)

A material is said to be **magnetic** if it has a net atomic dipole (due to, e.g., unpaired valence electrons) that can align with an external magnetic field.

![Ferromagnetic materials have "domains" of aligned magnets](images/10_magnetic-domains.png)

So-called "Permanent Magnets" are made from **ferromagnetic8* materials. These have large atomic dipoles and the ability to form large domains of aligned dipoles in the presence of an external magnetic field. These domains remain when the external field is removed.

![Iron and its unpaired electrons make it an archtypal ferromagnetic material](images/10_iron-unpaired-electrons.png)

If a ferromagnetic material is heated above a critical temperature (the Curie temperature) it loses the ability to form domains (and thus lasting magnetism). These materials are called **paramagnetic**.
