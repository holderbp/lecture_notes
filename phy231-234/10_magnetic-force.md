## Magnets and Magnetism

### Basic Properties of Magnets

* Magnets are intrinsically **dipolar**, having a "North" and a "South" **pole**.
* Magnetic dipoles cannot be divided into N/S monopoles, cutting a magnet in two creates two magnets:

* There are **attractive/repulsive forces** between opposite/same poles:

![Like poles of two magnets repel. Opposite poles attract](10_attract-repel-bar-magnet.png)

* A magnet has a surrounding magnetic field (more later).

![A compass needle is a magnet.  It aligns with the magnetic field of the earth and points toward geographic North.](10_geomagnetic-north-compass.png)

* A magnet (e.g., a compass needle) will *align* in the magnetic field of another magnet (e.g., the Earth). (There is a torque on a magnetic dipole causing this alignment, we will not explore this further).
