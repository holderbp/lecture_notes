CURRENT, RESISTANCE, AND OHM'S LAW
==================================

Current
-------

Electrical circuits --- lighting our homes, powering our phones, and controlling our own thoughts and actions in neural networks --- are driven by moving charge.

Consider an electric field passing through a metal cylinder:

![An upward vertical electric field passing through metal cylinder; negative charges experiencing downward electric force](images/07_Efield_through_metal.png)

- Free electrons will feel a force (opposite to the direction of $\vec{E}$, since $q_e = -e$)

- If the cylinder is allowed to come to equilibrium, the electrons will arrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero (the "static" or equilibrium case we have already discussed) with a build-up of negative charge on the bottom.

- If, however, another conductor (a wire) is attached, connecting the two ends of the cylinder, then the system will *not* come to equilibrium and electrons will flow in a loop or circuit.

- The flow rate of charge going past any cross-section of the conductor is called the **current**.

Since there is a force, $\vec{F}_E$, on the electrons, one might think that they accelerate (moving faster and faster around the circuit. In fact, they do not:

![Random thermal motion of electrons in a wire](images/07_thermal_motion_electrons_wire.png)

- At any nonzero temperature ($T>0$ K), the primary motion of electrons is *thermal*: fast and randomly-directed ($v_\text{th} \sim 10^5$ at room temperature).

- Electrons ove a very short distance before *colliding* with the metal's lattice of nuclei.

The electric force on free electrons in a conductor serves to change the thermal velocities very slightly, causing a small drift velocity, $v_d$, of electrons in the direction of the force.

- The drift velocity, even for large currents is very small: $v_d \sim 10^{-5}$ m/s $\ll v_\text{th} \sim 10^5$ m/s.

- Question: What is $v_d$ in cm/h?

Definitions of Current (I), Current Density (Jvec), and Resistivity (rho)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Def'n**: Take a long conductor (call it a "wire") with an electric field directed along its length, and consider any cross-sectional area of the wire, $A$. The **current passing through $A$** is:
$$
I = \frac{\text{Net charge passing through $A$ in $\Delta t$}}{\Delta t}
$$
