# RC Circuits

## Introduction and Overview

In the past few lectures we have studied circuits, in particular *circuits in equilibrium*. We looked at charged capacitors, which had been attached to an EMF (e.g., a battery) for a long time, leaving a charge $Q_\text{tot} = C \Delta V_C$.  We then looked at DC circuits with resistors, and we assumed that the currents in every wire was constant, unchanging in time.

Today we consider the first case of a circuit with *changing* current (we will see another example when we look at alternating current (AC) circuits, in which the power source is a sinusoidally oscillating EMF). Specifically, we will look at circuits with one capacitor and one resistor, and consider:

1. The discharge ($Q_\text{tot} \rightarrow 0$) of a charged capacitor, and
2. The charging of an unchanged capacitor ($0 \rightarrow Q_\text{tot}$) when connected to an EMF.

In each case, we will derive the time dependence of charge accumulation/loss, $Q(t)$, and thus also the dependence of $I(t)$ and $\Delta V_c(t)$.

To determine $Q(t)$ in each case above, we will write down a loop rule equation, $\sum \Delta V = 0$, show that it is actually a differential equation, and then solve the differential equation.
